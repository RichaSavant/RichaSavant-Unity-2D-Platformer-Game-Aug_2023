A side-scrolling platformer game using the Unity game development engine. This project focuses on developing a complete 2D game with engaging gameplay mechanics, character controls, level design, and interactive elements.

Key Implemented Features:

Character Movement and Controls:
Smooth and responsive character controls, including running, jumping, and crouching.
Integrated character animations for different actions to enhance visual appeal.

Level Design:
Multiple levels with increasing difficulty, featuring static and moving platforms.
Strategic placement of obstacles and enemies to challenge the player.

Game Mechanics:
Basic collision detection to ensure proper interaction between the character and the environment.
Implemented gravity and physics for realistic character movement and jumping.

User Interface (UI):
Basic in-game HUD (heads-up display) showing essential information such as score and health.
Simple main menu for starting the game and navigating between levels.

Scripting and Programming:
C# scripts to control character movement, enemy behavior, and level transitions.
Basic game logic implemented to handle player inputs and interactions.

The objective of this project is to develop a functional 2D platformer game that provides an enjoyable experience for players. Through this project, the developers have gained practical experience in using Unity for game development, including character control, level design, and basic game mechanics. This foundational project demonstrates effective game development practices and serves as a stepping stone for more complex game development endeavors in the future.
